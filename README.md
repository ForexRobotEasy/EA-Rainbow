# EA Rainbow - Forex Robot Easy

## Introduction
The EA Rainbow is a forex robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This robot is designed to automatically execute trades based on the Rainbow indicator values. It is a fully automated trading system that aims to generate profits by opening buy and sell positions in the forex market.

## Product Description
The EA Rainbow uses the Rainbow indicator, which calculates a value based on a combination of moving averages. The indicator is used to identify potential buy and sell signals in the market. When the Rainbow indicator value is above 0, it generates a buy signal, and when it is below 0, it generates a sell signal.

The EA Rainbow allows users to set the maximum number of buy and sell orders to be opened using the input parameters MaxBuys and MaxSells, respectively. Additionally, users can specify the starting lot size using the LotSize input parameter. The order comments can also be customized using the Comment input parameter.

The EA Rainbow utilizes the Trade and Indicators libraries to execute trades and calculate the Rainbow indicator values, respectively. The CTrade object from the Trade library is used to open buy and sell positions, while the CRainbow object from the Indicators library is used to calculate the Rainbow indicator values.

The trading function, OnTick(), is called on each tick of the market. In this function, the Rainbow indicator value is calculated using the iRainbow() function from the CRainbow object. If the Rainbow value is above 0 and the total number of buy orders opened is less than the maximum allowed buy orders, a buy position is opened using the Buy() function from the CTrade object. Similarly, if the Rainbow value is below 0 and the total number of sell orders opened is less than the maximum allowed sell orders, a sell position is opened using the Sell() function from the CTrade object.

The total number of buy and sell orders opened is tracked using the variables totalBuyOrders and totalSellOrders, respectively.

## Additional Functions
Additional functions can be added below the trading function if needed. These functions can be used to implement additional trading strategies or to enhance the functionality of the EA Rainbow.
